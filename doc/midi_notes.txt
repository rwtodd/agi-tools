... regarding converting AGI sounds to MIDI:

Since sound resources are timed to 1/60th of a second,
it seems I should set the time to SMPTE_30, with a
division of 2 ticks per 30th. That way, the durations
are 1:1.

(import  (javax.sound.midi Sequence Track MidiEvent ShortMessage MidiSystem))
(def tst (Sequence. Sequence/SMPTE_30 2))
(def t1 (.createTrack tst))
(.add t1 (MidiEvent. (ShortMessage. ShortMessage/NOTE_ON 0 60 100) 0))
(.add t1 (MidiEvent. (ShortMessage. ShortMessage/NOTE_OFF 0 60 0) 60))
(.add t1 (MidiEvent. (ShortMessage. ShortMessage/NOTE_ON 0 61 80) 60))
(.add t1 (MidiEvent. (ShortMessage. ShortMessage/NOTE_OFF 0 61 0) 120))
(MidiSystem/getMidiFileTypes tst)
(MidiSystem/write tst 1 (java.io.File. "C:/Users/richa/Documents/test.mid"))

Apparently, to pan a channel, we use CONTROL_CHANGE 10


NOTE:  Instruments I tend to like best for AGI songs:

0 = piano
7 = harpsichord
11 = music box
25 = nylon-string guitar
46 = pizzicato/harp?
82 - saw wave
87 - 5th saw
88 - bass and lead
91 - polysynth
